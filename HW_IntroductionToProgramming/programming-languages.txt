Programming Languages
C# - Object-oriented, component-oriented, functional, imperative, part of Microsoft.Net Framework platform. C# is based on C++ with elements from Visual Basic and Java. C# provides automatic garbage collection. Java also provides it. C and C++ don't. It's used for for office applications, web applications, websites, desktop applications, mobile applications, games and many others. 
C - General-purpose programming language, imperative. Many later languages have borrowed from C, including C++, D, Go, Rust, Java, JavaScript, Limbo, LPC, C#, Objective-C, Perl, PHP, Python, Verilog (hardware description language), and Unix's C shell. C is also used as an intermediate language for other languages.
C++ -  General-purpose, imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation. Many other programming languages have been influenced by C++, including C#, Java, and newer versions of C. It's used for for creating applications when close work with hardware needed, for special computer performance for 3D games and other.
Java - Designed to have the "look and feel" of the C++ language, but it is simpler to use than C++ and enforces an object-oriented programming model. Java can be used to create complete applications that may run on a single computer or be distributed among servers and clients in a network. It can also be used to build a small application module or applet for use as part of a Web page.
JavaScript - Client and server-side scripting language developed by Netscape that derives much of its syntax from C. It can be used across multiple web browsers and is considered essential for developing interactive or animated web functions. It is also used in game development and writing desktop applications.
